- Be a F16(john boyd), not just the plane that changes direction quickly but the whole system F16+pilot. A quick thinking pilot and a quick plane.

- be agile, change direction quickly competition can be beaten with speed
- mvp, iteration, pivot

- good pivot vs somene who is unfocussed(rabbit running down a maze)
  - right == first principles of the idea
  - pivot == first priciples are true, we learnt new things and we are doubling down

- first principle, surf a valid wave
  - you can’t control the wave
  - wave is bigger than company

- Moore’s law and Metcalfe’s law network effect

- magnitude of win > # of losses

- exponential power of idea

emphasis on:
- great businesses are truly valuable
- culture matters, once you go wrong you can’t back up

- bring abundance to the world > getting rich

- Be prime mover
- memetic behaviour, behaving because of the people around you

- pick billion dollar secrets from the ground rather than looking at others, gift that belongs to you

- `don’t have heroes, figure out what you admire about them and try to emulate that rather than saying you want to be like that person`

- think for yourselves always, `be greedy`

- think on first principles, seek people who challenges your first principles

- you are average of 5 people, they don’t need to be alive :)
