### Desired Aspects of the Software:
  - It should "just" work
  - Should have availabilty numbers, be reliable
  - Attraction for:
    1. Companies: Cheaper pricing model & flexibility to spike on low
       cost (low risk).
    2. Devs: Delivery model matters more
       - SaaS manages their own infra, low overhead
    3. Invertors: Easier to sell than licences, Predictable revenue,
       Possible to predict and plan the usage of funds better.
  - On-premise SaaS usually generate 10x more customer support tickets,
    mostly due to the non-uniform configs and env

### Saas Sales Models
1. Low Touch
2. High Touch

  - Low Touch:
    - Sells itself, Low human interaction required
    - Primary marketing channel: web, ususlly a free-trail model
    - Sales(Customer Success) Team's primary focus is to convert from free
      to paid
    - Requires excellent Customer Support, because the economics depend on
      long-term customer satisfaction
    - Generally sold on monthly subscription model
    - Average Contract Value(ACV): $5-$100/Customer
    - Monthly Recurring Revenue(MRR) is the most important metric

  - High Touch:
    - Human intensive
    - Sales team is more important part of the operation for lead
      conversion, supported by marketing for lead generation
    - Tickets per Customer is order of magnitude more than low touch.
      Usually B2B
    - ACV ~ $5k-15k/customer for SMBs to (higher 6 digits) for Enterprises
    - Annually Recurring Revenue(ARR) is the most important Metric

### Fundamental Eqn

    Revenue = # customers X Avg. life time Revenue per customer

    # of customer you get == (Aquisiton X Conversion Rate)/Churn

    Lifetime Value(LTV)

    Life time of a Customer = 1/Churn

### Implications of SaaS
- Improvements are multiplic atively effective as ~ (aquisition x coversion)
- Improving aquisition, conversion & churn often require major
  cross-functional effort
- Saas business eventually asymtotes, like log graph after initial
  exponential rise.
- The business which looses the ability improve on these three factors
  will stop growing and will die, if they cannot cover the fixed
cost (eg. Salaries) even if they do everything right

- SaaS are capital intensive
  - Companies optimizing  for growth will almost always spend more money
    than they collect in the begining
  - Typical SaaS spend less than 5-10% of the marginal revenue per
    customer on delivering the underlying service, which means insane
  - Only factor of Unit Economics remains is the Customer Aquisiton
    Cost(CAC)
  - Fast growing one's usually ignore this expenses that doesn't scale
    directly with # of customers ie. engineering cost
  - Takes a while to grow, the usual time frame for a bootstrapped on is
    18 months.

- Funded SaaS are designed to trade cash for growth, while perfecting
  the model.

- *Rule*

    Triple the annual revenue for the fist two years and double it for
the next three years
