### Saas Sales Models
1. Low Touch
2. High Touch

  - Low Touch:
    - Sells itself, Low human interaction required
    - Primary marketing channel: web, ususlly a free-trail model
    - Sales(Customer Success) Team's primary focus is to convert from free
      to paid
    - Requires excellent Customer Support, because the economics depend on
      long-term customer satisfaction
    - Generally sold on monthly subscription model
    - Average Contract Value(ACV): $5-$100/Customer
    - Monthly Recurring Revenue(MRR) is the most important metric

  - High Touch:
    - Human intensive
    - Sales team is more important part of the operation for lead
      conversion, supported by marketing for lead generation
    - Tickets per Customer is order of magnitude more than low touch.
      Usually B2B
    - ACV ~ $5k-15k/customer for SMBs to (higher 6 digits) for Enterprises
    - Annually Recurring Revenue(ARR) is the most important Metric

    # of customer you get == Aquisiton X Conversion Rate

    Lifetime Value(LTV)

    Life time of a Customer = 1/Churn
